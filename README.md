# StatusR
StatusR is a simple bash script for showing the status of:
- Internet connection
- DNS server status
- Internet threat level
- Egypt's power grid ( thanks to http://www.mos3abof.com/  and http://www.gridstatusnow.com/  )
- Weather
- Space weather

StatusR is very configurable and can be used to learn bash scripting and can be forked to get different information than what it was originally created for.

the script needs the program lynx to be installed.
on ubuntu > sudo apt-get install lynx
Now it checks to see if you have lynx installed or not and if not it tells you
the first thing to do is to make the script executable.
edit the script using a text editor to change the weather link to point to your desired city/station, then edit any thing else you see fit like the DNS you use.
