# StatusR
StatusR is a simple bash script for showing the status of:
- Internet connection
- DNS server status
- Internet threat level
- Egypt's power grid ( thanks to http://www.mos3abof.com/  and http://www.gridstatusnow.com/  )
- Weather
- Space weather

StatusR is very configurable and can be used to learn bash scripting and can be forked to get different information than what it was originally created for.
